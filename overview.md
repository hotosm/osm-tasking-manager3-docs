The HOT OSM Tasking Manager is a tool that coordinates many people mapping a specific geographic area in OpenStreetMap.

OpenStreetMap is a collabarative, crowd sourced, free map of the world. Anyone can contribute to OpenStreetMap to map any part of the world that interests them. The Tasking Manager is just a way to coordinate large groups of people contributing to OpenStreetMap but most contributions to OpenStreetMap are done by people not using the Tasking Manager.

The Tasking Manager is a totally seperate tool from the main OpenStreetMap project. When you are contributing to OpenStreetMap using the Tasking Manager, you are actually using multiple software tools:

* OpenStreetMap - A database of geographic information
* The Tasking Manager - Helps coordinate large numbers of people editing OpenStreetMap data in the same area
* An OpenStreetMap Editor - A software program that can read and write data into the OpenStreetMap database

The **OpenStreetMap** database is where all of your mapping is stored. This is a live database and everything you change, add or delete from it is reflected in the global database in real time. Your main way of interacting with the OpenStreetMap database is through one of the OpenStreetMap editors listed below. Every OpenStreetMap editor will have a way to download existing geographic data (buildings, roads, waterways, etc) and display that data (sometimes there is no data for an area you are mapping), provide you with tools to create geographic data (usually by tracing roads or buildings on satellite imagery), and save your new data back to the OpenStreetMap database.

## The Tasking Manager

The role of **the Tasking Manager** is to present a specific geographic region divided up into small, quick to map areas called "Tasks" and provide a way to "checkout" or "lock" one of those small areas while you map that area using one of the standard OpenStreetMap Editors. By "checking out" or "locking" one of those small areas, you help ensure that no one else will be mapping in that same area while you are. This helps prevent "double mapping" or other errors when two people are working on exactly the same area in OpenStreetMap.

Once you are done mapping that small area, you record in the Tasking Manager that you have finished mapping that small area and hopefully you select another "Task" to map.

## OpenStreetMap Editors

An **OpenStreetMap editor** is what is used to actually create map data that gets stored in OpenStreetMap. The two main OpenStreetMap editors are the web browser based "iD Web Editor" (iD) and the desktop program "Java OpenStreetMap Editor" (JOSM). When you "Start Mapping" in the Tasking Manager, you will be transfered to one of those editors, which are outside of the Tasking Manager, and using one of those programs you will do the actual mapping. There will be an outline of the "Task" (small area you are going to map) so you know exactly what area you need to map. 

Once you complete mapping the "Task" area, you will switch back to the Tasking Manager and mark that "Task" "Complete" or "Done". If you did not map the whole "Task" area, there is an option to just "Stop Mapping", which will "unlock" that "Task" so someone else can "check it out" and finish the mapping.
