# Validation

Validation is the process of a second mapper reviewing the mapping of the initial mapper of a Project Task. It is designed to ensure complete, quality data and provide thanks, feedback and encouragment to mappers.

## Getting Started

Validation starts much the same way as mapping does, a volunteer finds a Project they would like to work on, reads the Instructions tab to be sure they understand what is called for and how it is expected to be mapped, but instead of selecting the Mapping tab for the Project, they select the "Validate" tab.

The validator can select a Task by clicking on an individual Task, clicking "Select a random Task", select by user or draw a polygon the select multiple, connected Tasks.

Unlike mappers, Validators can select multiple Tasks to perform validation on a larger scale than just one Task.

## Selecting Multiple Tasks for Validation

New in the latest version of the Tasking Manager is the ability to select multiple tasks for validation, either by area or by user.

Depending on which editor you are using, this feature will behave differently.

In JOSM, a second OSM data layer will be created titled "Task Boundaries - Do Not Edit or Upload" and it will have uploading disabled in recent versions of JOSM. JOSM **will not download the OSM data** because it could be a very large amount of data. Instead the validator will have to use the task boundaries as a guide and download the data to the active editing layer manually.

### Select by drawing a polygon

This option allows a validtor to draw a square around a group of tasks and check them all out at once.

Once in the editor of their choice, **the validator will have to manually download the OSM data** for Task areas selected. This is to prevent downloading all of the OSM data between the selected Tasks.

### Select By User

A list of mappers who have marked a Task as done is presented. Hovering over anyone in the list will highlight the Tasks they have marked as completed. The list also prensents three important pieces of information about the mapper, their experience level, the number of days since they first started mapping using the Tasking Manager and the number of days since they last received feedback via Valiation. This allows the validator to specifically target new mappers, experienced mappers or mappers who have not had any feedback for an extended period of time.

Clicking on the "Start Validating" button will lock all the Tasks completed by that mapper and allow the validator to open them in their editor of choice.

### Finalizing Validation

Once the validator has finished the validation process either for one Task or multiple Tasks, they should return to the Tasking Manager and select one of the three choices that reflect the mapping of the Task:

- Stop Validating - If you could not complete the validation process but must stop validating.
- Mark (all) as Valid - If the mapping is complete and accurate
- Mark (all) as Invalid - If the mapping is not complete or inaccurate.

For the last two choices the Validator can and should leave a friendly, encouraging comment addressed to the mapper(s) involved and provide thanks for their contributions and feedback on their mapping.
